    "These results could not give meaningful interpretations for now. Indeed, the classification method has to be improved. The main problem that seems to arise is the too large size (20 000 entries) of the informal dictionary used for classification. In next step, the dictionnary has to be filtered to keep only the terms that clearly distinguish informal/colloquial langage. It has to be avoid the terms that lies in the two categories. Additionnaly, the speakers with a too low number of quotations has to be filtered as their aggregation could biased the result.\n",
