in advance
alive and kicking
all of a sudden
all over the place
to go from bad to worse
to bag 
beat-up
to do the best
blabber
to blag 
bloody
to be blue
a closed book  
bouncer
bowl of cherries
be broke
to brush up on 
buck
butt
buzz
Buzz off!
a close call
like cat and dog  
to catch something
to catch a cold
to catch a cold
not to have a clue
Come off it
as far as I'm concerned
cop
corner shop
cram school
on credit
cut
damned
to drive like the devil  
to dig in one's heels
dirt cheap  
to disrespect
to do one's best
to do someone good
to do without
down under
to be up to one's ears
to eat like a horse 
to eat like a pig
every now and then
every other
to see eye to eye
fair enough
fiddle
to keep the fingers crossed
flutter
folk
for free
freak out
fridge
to get a lot of stick
to get cold feet
to get fed up with 
to get rid of
to take for granted
greasy spoon
groovy
guy
had better
on the other hand
to give a hand
hard graft
by heart
hip
 to be hooked on
knackered
to keep an eye
little by little
to look forward to 
to make ends meet
to make friends easily
to make oneself at home
to make the most
to make up one's mind
mash
What's the matter
to be mean
to meet  somebody  halfway
to mess around
to mess u p
 from now on
old fart
pint
to be pissed off
pitchdark  
plonk
to come to the point
to pop in
to put in a word for 
 pretty much
out of the question
quid
red tape
right as rain
to sack  somebody
scruffy
to see about
sharpish
to sing like an angel  
to be in someone's shoes
to shut up
can't stand
in the sticks
to stick 
stroppy
stuff
Take it easy  
telly
thick
Think nothing of it  
to be on time
to take one's time
tipple
tomato-red hair
to loose track
to take turns
Watch your step
like water on a hot stone  
to wear many hats
to feel under the weather
when push comes to shove
as white as snow  
no wonder
a word in your ear
Words fail me
to eat one's words
in other words
to have words with 
to work like a dog  
would rather
 I'd rather
 to wow
to zing through
