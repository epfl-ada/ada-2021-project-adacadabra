### Title :
    
Exploratory analysis of the use of informal language in English speaking newspapers
    
### Abstract:
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

<hr> 

### Project idea : 
The dataset could be used to identify an evolution of the use of informal language through time in the media. If put into prospective with the context of use, it could help detect long term changes or phenomena. We will try to understand how the importance of formal language evolves when making public statements. 
By comparing the use of informal language within newspapers rather than across time, it could be possible to evaluate a component of the journalistic quality of different sources or caracteristics of the speaker directly.

### Goals :
Find relations between the use of informal langage and some metadata (politic orientation, occupation,  of the speaker).
    
### Motivations:
The idea for this project was born out of a general observation by a member of the group: the interview or newspaper archives give the impression that the language used was more formal than the one used today. In other words, the langage is in constant evolution and the usage of colloquial langage appears more and more frequently in the public debate. For example, the speech of Donald Trump during the two latest US electoral campaign is based on massive utilisation of slang words and expressions, as it can be seen in the [nicknames he regularly gave to his opponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nicknames_used_by_Donald_Trump) (like "Sleppy Joe" or "Crazy Hillary")
.

Given this intuition, the informal language seems to be an interesting subject to focus on. Therefore, the main dilemma is to study how to easily detect the use of colloquial language and find appropriate criteria that caracterise it. Thanks to research and discussions with a graduate student in English literature, it appears that the usage of informal language is mainly linked to the usage of a specific vocabulary. [reference ?] Therefore, the large number of quotations containing in the Quotebank dataset seems to offer a great opportunity to obtain a general overview on these aspects

### Story : 

| Step | idea | Description  |
|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|
|1. | Presentation of Quotebank | geographical representation, standard stastitics with fancy representation to present the dataset to the visitor of the page |
|2. | Presentation of the method used to classify the quotes | description of the method and index used, results on the most used words, statistics on the frequency of each entry (Zipf law ?) |
|3. | Exploratory analyisis |explore the relation between the metadata and the classification of the quotes |
|4. | Identify the key correlation | Linear regression with coefficient which could have an influence on the output (informal/formal) | 
|5. | Explanatory study | choose a relation and investigate in depth how is it possible (or not) to explain it |
|6. | Conclusion | Highlight the fact that correlation ≠ to causation, limits on your study |
    
#### Research Questions:
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. --> link to papers

 - Can the use of informal language provide information about political orientation (via wikidata) ?

 - Does the professional occupation /political party has an influence on the use the colloquial language (via wikidata) ?

 - Do the standard metrics (age, gender, nationality) have any influence on the studied topic (via wikidata) ?

 - Do some newspapers favorise the presence of informal langage or try to limit it ? What does it tell us about journalistic quality of the  data sources (via WHOIS requests) ? --> à reformuler

### Proposed additional datasets:
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

- Speakers metadata : Using the provided parquet file, the informations (gender, age, occupation, nationality, religion ...) of each speakers were extracted (cf. `SPEAKERS_METADATA/Retrieve_metadata.ipynb`) The parquet file was converted into a pandas dataframe and the QIDs into meaningful informations thanks to the lookup table provided.

- Newspapers metadata : explain the

### Methods :
**Process flow diagram of the project**

The process has passed throug the following steps:

- Defining a sample to handle data size (see Notebook `Sample_creation.ipynb`)

- DataWrangling (see Notebook `Data Wrangling Quotebank.ipynb`)

- Suppression of quotes according the following criteria
      
  - have meaningless probabilities ($p not in interval [0,1]$)
  - is not clearly identified (threshold to be defined: *threshold_min*)
  - is probably confused with another speaker (threshold to be defined: *threshold_diff*)
  - is not identified (None values)

- Classification (see Notebook `comparison_SlangDict_quotes.ipynb`): 
  - It consists simply to search for a specific word or expression from the dictionnary in each quote of the dataset. If a match is found, the dictionnary is updated to contain the number of time the word has been found in the quotes. This value is then used to reduce the dictionnary size. Without this reduction all quotes are categorised as colloquial which is not surprising given the size of the dictionary used (>20'000 entries). This is why we will focus on the less frequently occurring terms (occuring once in a thousand quotes), which will define a clearer distinction between formal and informal language.

  - Note that initially, other method were also tested without much sucess (as vector space retrieval, word embeddings, ...). They are all presented in the following notebook: `CLASSIFICATION/Segmentation_model/methods_language_processing.ipynb`. 

Analysis : What analysis we will make in Milestone 3?
    
#### Proposed timeline 

**22.10 -> 29.10** 

- Review of the ideas proposed in M1 by each team member. 
- Data wrangling questions : how retrieving the dataset? / how to use the metadata from wikidata? / how to retrieve informations on papers used? 
- Methods : explore the different techniques (PCA, idt) to classify words.

<hr>

**29.10 -> 05.11**

- Creation of common sample set (about 200 000 quotes per year) to test uniformly our methods (wrangling, classification, analysis)
- Retrieval and data wrangling on metadata from Wikidata. 
- Compute statistics on the metadata to better understand the quotebank dataset. 
- Data Wrangling on quotations : drop nan, drop quotes with p(attribution) smaller than threshold, consistent types, unique identifiers. 

<hr>

**05.11 -> 12.11** 

- Focus on the method to distinguish formal and informal language.
- Apply it to the sample .
- Clean readme and notebooks of code.
