Eric Schmidt [ the executive chairman of Google's parent company ] was a major backer of Hillary Clinton. But power is power, and Trump has demonstrated a similar tendency to throw his ever-expanding weight around. Like Google, he doesn't particularly like to be criticized, if you hadn't noticed... Whether it's a giant left-leaning corporation or an unhinged alt-right president, the underlying problem is the same. It imperils our democracy and breeds distrust in our system.

On the other hand, if we close the tax loophole, we could double the number of workers in America's job training programs. We could help another 4 million students afford college. These are sensible choices that, if you were running your business, and you took a look at it, you'd make that decision. Well, America should too.

And I think the administration's decision to try to cozy up to Russia means that they're not willing to call a humanitarian war crime exactly what it is. We've seen this a couple of times from the administration. Second, the reason for the humanitarian safe zone was because the UN called for cross-border delivery of humanitarian aid in February of 2014. But the world community has done nothing, nothing to enforce that. And you can't have a statement of principle from the international world on something like this, and do nothing to enforce it. And so, while it's gotten more complicated because of the entrance of the Russians and the Turkish-Kurdish dispute on the border, we should still try to provide a place in Syria where people can stay in their own country, which they want to do, safe from the atrocities of Bashar al-Assad or ISIS."

1342,"In Wisconsin, a Koch Industries -- backed group recently moved closer toward a major legislative victory, with an anti-regulations bill it has pushed for years passing in the Wisconsin Senate. That bill, the REINS (Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny) Act, passed 19-14 as SB 15. It mandates that if a proposed rule causes' $10 million or more in implementation and compliance costs' over a two-year period, that regulation must either be rewritten or discarded. Before taking effect, it still has to pass an Assembly vote and get the signature of Republican Gov. Scott Walker. The Wisconsin version of REINS has moved in parallel to a federal version moving through Congress, also called the REINS Act. It too has been pushed for years by the Koch-funded network, which passed in January in the U.S. House of Representatives and now awaits a Senate vote. The federal version has the backing of President Donald Trump. A major force behind both versions of REINS is the Koch-founded and funded group, Americans for Prosperity (AFP). In Wisconsin, AFP ran an advertising campaign in support of the bill, started a petition, testified for it at a hearing, and deployed lobbyists to advocate on its behalf. After the bill passed in the Wisconsin Senate, AFP praised the legislative body's efforts. `The Wisconsin REINS Act would require that new regulations with an economic impact on the taxpayer greater than $10 million be voted on by the people's representatives in the legislature,' reads the petition. `This one change would tie the hands of big government activists for generations to come, restore Democracy to regulations, and provide businesses with the certainty they need to invest in jobs and wages in Wisconsin.' Unmentioned in the petition: Wisconsin-based Koch businesses could also benefit financially from the bill if it becomes law, as its business assets in the states are highly polluting. Koch Industries owns subsidiaries including Georgia-Pacific, Flint Hills Resources, and Koch Minerals, which in turn own assets such as paper production mills, pipelines, and oil and gas storage facilities."

And I think the biggest part with the car insurance that I want people to understand, when we have a bill that was written by the car insurance companies for their benefit, that's why it did not pass. when we had Sam Bernstein, the ambulance chaser from Detroit, and the mayor of Detroit, who was the author of the bill, the U.P. was not going to have the savings that my opponent keeps talking about. There was going to be harm to us, and like I say, when people are driving down the road drunk, and people are causing accidents and things are happening, we want to see something that's going to be there for us, the customer, not just to benefit the insurance companies. They got enough people looking to protect them; it's called a lobby corps, they got attorneys, they got everybody on their side. You have to have people as elected officials that are going to stand up for our benefit to make sure when you're in an accident, that the hospital bill is covered because they're not going to take a chicken, they're going to have to be paid, and somebody's going to have to pay that."

He wants to build more walls-not bridges. His call for an end to the Russia investigation is yet another effort to derail and even obstruct or avoid any accountability for potential wrongdoing. That line shows all the more why the Special Counsel must do a report with all the facts and evidence and disclose it directly to the American people.
